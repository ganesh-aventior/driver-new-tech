Take clone from bitbucket using below command

    cd ~
    git clone git@github.com:hsarbas/DRIVER2.0.git

Run production.sh from driver_new_tech

    cd driver_new_tech
    sudo bash production_host.sh

**Environment**

You must define the constant values in the .env file. A template .env.sample is provided which contains the keys and
values required to run DRIVER2.0.

Create .env file in the project directory refer template .env.sample follow steps below:

    cd /var/www/driver_new_tech/
    sudo nano .env
    save and close the file

In the project directory(/var/www/driver_new_tech/) as a superuser, execute steps below:

    docker-compose up -d

There are 5 containers running as daemons in order to make DRIVER2.0 available. The nginx server is set up at the host
in the standard mode.

Review the containers using below command

    docker ps

Execute the configure.sh file using below commands.

    cd /var/www/driver_new_tech/
    ./configure.sh

Enter username,email,password for superuser.

Execute the script to create initial dataset by using below command. "driver-new-tech" is a name of docker 
container you can replace it by yours(in case modified).

    docker exec "driver-new-tech" ./manage.py create_dataset

Create Incident and Intervention schema using below commands.

    docker exec "driver-new-tech" python ./scripts/load_incident_schema.py --api-url 'http://{{ip_addr/domain_name}}/api'
    
    docker exec "driver-new-tech" python ./scripts/load_intervention_schema.py  --api-url 'http://{{ip_addr/domain_name}}/api'

Add English language for both Admin&User panel using below command.

    python ./scripts/load_default_languages.py --api-url 'http://{{ip_addr/domain_name}}/api'

Change API HOST for:

Admin Panel

    change <app-root hostname = "http://{{ip_addr/domain_name}}/"> to running ip ip_addr/domain_name

User Panel

    sudo nano User-Panel/dist/WB-Driver/index.html
    change <app-root hostname = "http://{{ip_addr/domain_name}}/" windshaftUrl = "http://{{ip_addr/domain_name}}"></app-root> to running ip_addr/domain_name

Link for accessing User & Admin panel:

User panel "http://{{ip_addr/domain_name}}/"

Admin panel "http://{{ip_addr/domain_name}}/editor/"

**To login into the User Panel, it is mandatory to add the Geography files (City/Province or Regions).**

Once this is completed, the following needs to be installed from the Admin Panel:
The SuperAdmin now needs to login to the Ashlar Editor using the credentials built while creating SuperAdmin from the
database. (eg. username:- driver, password:- driver).

Once the user is logged in into the Ashlar Editor, they first need to add the shapefiles for the city and region. To do
so, the user should follow the following steps:

All Geography -> Add New Geography -> (for City/Province)
Geography Label -> City/Province Display Field (select after upload) -> name (this will only be enabled when the user
saves the label, file, and Geography Color)
Geography Color -> red All Geography -> Add New Geography -> (for Regions)
Geography Label -> Regions Display Field (select after upload) -> region (this will only be enabled when the user saves
the label, file, and Geography Color)
Geography Color -> red

After uploading the shapefiles, the user now needs to set permissions for the already existing 2 user groups i.e.
SuperAdmin and Public. To set the permissions for these 2 groups, the user needs to follow the following steps:
Manage Permissions -> Click on “Edit” in front of the SuperAdmin -> The user needs to check the checkbox in front of “Is
admin” and check the checkboxes against the following: record, recordduplicate, recordauditlogentry, savedfilter. For
Public, the user needs to click on the Edit button against the Public group name and check the checkboxes against it:
sendrolerequest, savedfilter. Now the Administrator needs to create 4 more user groups and add permissions to it. To do
so, the Administrator needs to click on “Add Group Permission”. On the Assign Permission the Administrator needs to add
the “Group Name”, “Description”, check on Is Admin (only for the Admin Users i.e. City/Organizational Admin and Regional
Admin), and add the permissions. The permissions will be as follows:
Regional Admin -> record, recordduplicate, sendrolerequest, savedfilter. City/Organizational Admin -> record,
recordduplicate, sendrolerequest, savedfilter. Analyst -> record, sendrolerequest, savedfilter. Tech Analyst -> In the
record, the Administrator needs to click on “Can view record ”, sendrolerequest, savedfilter Public -> In the record,
the Administrator needs to click on “Can view record ”, sendrolerequest, savedfilter.

NOTE:- We will be writing an automated script for all these permissions so that they can be set automatically.

Once all the permissions are set, the user needs to “Add New Record Type”. The 2 record types are Incident and
Intervention. This can be done, by All Record Types -> Add a new record type. Single Title -> Incident Plural Title ->
Incidents Description -> Historical incident data

Single Title -> Intervention Plural Title -> Interventions Description ->Actions to improve traffic safety

This will create 2 items in the side navbar. Now the user can create the required schema for the Incident and
Intervention form. The following should fall under Incidents:
